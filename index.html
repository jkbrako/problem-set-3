    <p> As a disclaimer, basketball is one of my favorite sports. I have played in
      organized baketball leagues such as a recreational league. I have considered playing
      for my home district as it seems it could benefit me on a college resume or
      even a college scholarship further down the road. However, the cons of playing
      school basketball at the high level far outweighs the pros. This article will illustrate
      the troubles of high school basketball up to playing college basketball and the counterarguments to them. <p>
